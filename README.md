# Reader Sample Code
Demonstrates and provides source code on how to operate various RAIN RFID readers to measure Axzon's sensor tags

Script files are included to compile and run the sample code, printing the results to a command-line window. They rely on the PATH environment variable to locate the compiler/executable. The script files may be modified to reference the appropriate absolute path instead.

## Reader Sample Code
Demonstrates and provides source code on how to operate various RAIN RFID readers to measure Axzon's sensor tags

## QuickStart
1) Ensure programming language requirements are met (see below)
2) Power up and connect reader
3) Determine reader address (i.e. COM port or IP address)
4) Edit 'Common' file with address, active antenna port(s), and regulatory region
5) Run appropriate 'Demo' script

## Requirements
Script files are included to compile and run the sample code, printing the results to a command-line window. They rely on the PATH environment variable to locate the compiler/executable. The script files may be modified to reference the absolute path instead.
### Java
Java must be installed with the JVM (java.exe) and compiler (javac.exe) available on the PATH environment variable. For example:
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_181\bin\java.exe
- C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_181\bin\javac.exe
### C#
.NET Framework must be installed with the C# Compiler (csc.exe) available on the PATH environment variable. For example:
- C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\csc.exe
### C
TBD
